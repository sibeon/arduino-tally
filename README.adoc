* UDPTally
* UDPTallyHub
* UDPTallyHubClient

== UDPTally

This is the Client program for the Tally UDP protocol.

== UDPTallyHub

This program is a standalone HUB that dustributes the channel states of an ATEM Switcher

== UDPTallyHubClient

This is a combination of the HUB and the client. The defined channel of this Tally will be handled by itself and not distributed.
